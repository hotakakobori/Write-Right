## Abstract
A repository that collects resources on writing in field of Economics (esp. Applied) for young professionals. 

## Motivation 

While writing my [MSc thesis](https://github.com/hotakakobori/MSc-Thesis-Replication), it just occured to me that resources writing in field of Economics are scattered all over the internets. This repo aims to collect some of them and become a _go-to-place_ for young professionals like myself.
